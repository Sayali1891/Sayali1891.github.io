Good facilities planning and design enhances the work environment, and a well-planned and designed building can increase the performance of the people and the organisation(s) that occupy it. A poorly designed building affects the productivity of its occupants.<br>
There are four main types of facility layouts: process, product, fixed-position, and cellular.<br>
The design of a facility can has a significant impact on employee health and productivity. Poor design can lead to ergonomic problems, increased stress, and a general feeling of dissatisfaction. These problems can have a negative impact on employee health and well-being, as well as on productivity
To ensure the quality and performance of mechanical systems, we have dedicated testing and measurement facilities. This includes a materials testing lab equipped with equipment for tensile, compression, and fatigue testing of different materials.<br><br>

<br><br>Mechanical Inspection The purpose of the mechanical inspection is to visually inspect and operate the built-in mechanical equipment observed on site and provide an opinion of any deficiencies apparent at the time of the inspection. The scope of this inspection includes visual observations of the readily accessible mechanical equipment and appliances without disassembly of any unit inspected and without removing items causing visual obstruction. The functional equipment is generally operated in at least one mode, but not necessarily every mode, suited to demonstrate its condition. Special equipment present on site, not normally encountered for the type of structure and/or not related to operation of the structure, may not be included without request, or if Professional Engineering Inspections, Inc. is not familiar with the equipment. This includes, but is not limited to, elevator systems, lifts, pumping systems, irrigation systems. <br><br>

<br><br>Machining is the process of cutting, shaping, or removing material from a workpiece using a machine tool. All our machining is done on the highest quality machine tools. A reamer is a tool used in machining to make existing holes more accurate.Mechanical machining processes have been used for decades for the production of components made from a wide variety of different materials. In particular, the processing of metals and alloys such as copper, brass, bronze and steels is used for the fabrication of single products, such as tools, as well as standard products.In the field of precision engineering, components with micrometer-precision have already been produced for several decades. As manufacturing processes, machining processes such as precision milling and turning are used as well as electro-erosive processes such as wire and spark erosion. In some branches that make use of complex machinable materials that must not be subjected to any thermal change during processing, electrochemical machining is additionally used.
