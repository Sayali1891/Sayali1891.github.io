<b><br>WELDING FIXTURE</b><br><br>
A welding fixture is a device or tool that is used to hold, position, and locate workpieces during the welding process. Welding fixtures are designed to ensure that the workpieces are held securely in the correct position and orientation, so that the welds are made accurately and consistently. <br>
A welding fixture is designed in a way to support and locate the components to be welded to avoid distortions and weld stresses. It is obvious that each welding operation requires a distinct welding fixture according to our desired requirements. A fixture generally holds the part during welding, but there is a chance of the part being distorted after the removal of the fixture. Hence some stress-relieving and other post-processing operations can be performed to prevent weld distortions.

<b><br>PNEUMATIC FIXTURE</b><br><br>
Pneumatic Fixtures. Pneumatic actuation is used to open and close the jaw faces on these grips, ideal for high volume testing and maintaining a consistent clamping pressure.<br>
Compared to electric power tool equivalents, pneumatic tools are safer to run and maintain, without risk of sparks, short-circuiting or electrocution, and have a higher power to weight ratio, allowing a smaller, lighter tool to accomplish the same task.<br>
Some examples of pneumatic devices are rock drills, pavement breakers, riveters, forging presses, paint sprayers, blast cleaners, and atomizers. An air compressor is one of the major types of pneumatic devices. They are power-driven machines that compress air from initial intake pressure to a higher pressure.

<b><br>WELDING FIXTURE FOR SEATING SYSTEM</b><br><br>
A Welding Fixture for seating system is a part-holding tool used to constrain components for welding in an automated system. To ensure the tool can withstand the demands of a mass production environment, typically the fixture needs to be custom built for the welding process. <br>
The weld tooling must be built to have adjustability for fixture tune-in to the proper dimensions. Sometimes welding fixtures are used on turnkey robotic cells with built-in rotating positioners, other times custom robotic cells are built to properly complete a welding process for the lowest cost and floorspace usage. A good systems integrator like Stryver will work with you to complete process analysis to determine the best, most cost-efficient welding solution for your parts.

<b><br>INSPECTION FIXTURE</b><br><br>
Inspection is a routine component of the manufacturing process; as parts come off of the production line, some are examined to ensure accurate dimensions. This process requires specialized workholding. Two examples include CMM fixtures and check gauges.<br>
A coordinate-measuring machine (CMM) is a precision tool that probes multiple points on a part to determine if the geometry is within specification. Check gauges are another form of inspection fixture used to quickly and accurately determine if parts are satisfying basic tolerances. If the part fits into the gauge, the part is within specification.<br>
These fixtures need to satisfy stiffness and precision requirements, which traditionally would mean they would be custom-machined out of aluminum. However, the process is expensive and depletes valuable shop time. As the effort increases with the complexity of machined parts, it becomes even more cumbersome to manufacture inspection fixtures that must contain intricate geometries.

<b><br>PANEL CHECKERS</b><br><br>
We are offering Panel Checker for Checking Sheet Metal Parts to our clients. These fixtures are used to check the hole / slot position profile & trim lines of press parts. Normally Fixture is designed in car line condition. The location, resting, clamping & checking points are selected as per the GD & T drawing provided by the customer.
We can manufacture large size panel checkers. <BR>
Panel checkers are checking fixtures to check sheet metal components. Panel checkers are generally offset of the component therefore gap, flush and trim line of a sheet metal component can be checked easily
